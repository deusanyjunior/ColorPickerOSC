# ColorPickerOSC

<br/>

Pick a color and send through OSC. 
The user selects the color and the alpha through a color picker interface.
Each modification is sent through OSC to an IP defined on the settings.
Actually, the UnicastUDP is the only protocol available.
The settings have options to define the IP and Port.


TODO:
- optimize the interface object SeekBar Alpha
- add Multicast support
- add preference option to change the OSC mapping
